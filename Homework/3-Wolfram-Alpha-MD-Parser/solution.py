input_text = '''Solve for x:
3 x + 6 = 0

Hint: | Isolate terms with x to the left hand side.
Subtract 6 from both sides:
3 x + (6 - 6) = -6

Hint: | Look for the difference of two identical terms.
6 - 6 = 0:
3 x = -6

Hint: | Divide both sides by a constant to simplify the equation.
Divide both sides of 3 x = -6 by 3:
(3 x)/3 = (-6)/3

Hint: | Any nonzero number divided by itself is one.
3/3 = 1:
x = (-6)/3

Hint: | In (-6)/3, divide 6 in the numerator by 3 in the denominator.
6/3 = (3Ã—2)/3 = 2:
Answer: | 
 | x = -2'''
