# Data formats
When using APIs and other web service related tools, we will be using multiple different kinds of data formats and data structures. For example, JSON, XML, CSV and YAML.

This weeks lecture's last slide(s?) has a data format lab/exercise. Some solutions can be found in this folder. If you want XML (which does not have a suggested solution here), google "JSON to XML converter" or something like that, convert, and see if your answer works.
